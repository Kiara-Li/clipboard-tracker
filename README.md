# clipboard-tracker
In our rapid-fire digital lives, the act of "copy-pasting" is often mindless—a fleeting mechanical gesture that treats information as disposable. We accumulate data without reflection, leading to cognitive clutter and a disconnection from the knowledge we interact with.
To address this, I propose Clipboard Forest, a browser extension that reimagines the clipboard not as a temporary buffer, but as a permanent digital garden. Conceptually, the tool transforms every copied text snippet into a unique geometric "tree." The source domain dictates the species (e.g., code becomes blocks, social media becomes circles), while the text length determines the height.
Practically, the software visualizes a user’s daily information intake as a growing ecosystem. Through a horizontal "Daily View," users can scroll through their day's timeline, witnessing their forest grow from left to right. By turning abstract data into a visible landscape, Clipboard Forest creates a feedback loop of mindfulness. It forces users to witness their consumption habits, turning the passive act of copying into an active practice of cultivation. Interactive features like "pruning" (editing tree types) and "returning to soil" (revisiting sources) ensure information is not just moved, but meaningfully transplanted.

## Features

- Track and visualize your copied text history  
- Generate geometric “trees” based on clipboard items  
- Export and share your generated forest with others  

## Future Roadmap

### **More Forest Editing Permissions**  
- Allow users to edit pasted text directly.  
- Tree height updates automatically when text length changes.  
- Tree color or shape can change based on content, sentences, or topics.

### **Visual & Aesthetic Enhancements**  
- Introduce additional tree species, colors, and styles to enrich the forest.  
- Improve the overall interface and visual design for a more immersive experience.

### **Merge Functionality**  
- Enable users to merge multiple small text snippets from the same source into a single tree.  
- Helps organize the forest more efficiently and reduces visual clutter.
